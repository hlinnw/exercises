## Images and Graphics
 1. Images
 - There are four attributes we want to include on every image element. The source attribute, shortened to SRC. The alt attribute, ALT. And the width and height attributes. 

 <img src="img.png" width="400" height="200">

 2. Image formats
 - Gif

 <img src="Gif.png" width="400">

 - SVG

 <img src="Svg.png" width="400">

 - Vector files are images that are built by mathematical formulas that establish points on a grid

 - JPG

 <img src="JPG.png" width="400">

 - PNG

 <img src="PNG.png" width="400">

 3. Responsive images
 - The simplest way to support different screens is to create multiple copies of our image in different resolutions and then tell the browser that those copies are available. The device can then decide what it wants to do. The browser will look at the screen density, the network connection, the users settings and decide which image to use. 

 <img src="responsive images.png" width="500">

 4. Responsive width

 <img src="responsive width.png" width="500">

 - srcset gives you two options for communicating to the browser that there are a set of images available to use.
 - The sizes attribute gives you a way to specify for the browser how much of the viewport's width that image will take up at which break point.

 6. Figure and figcaption
 - `<figure></figure>` use figure for things besides images, like an interactive graphic.
 - `<figcaption></figcaption>` wrap the text in the figcaption element
