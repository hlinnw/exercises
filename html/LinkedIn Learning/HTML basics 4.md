## Linking and Navigation

1. links
- Make a link using an absolute URL as your path

- HTTP stands for Hypertext Transport Protocol. This is a way that everything on the web talks to everything else. The protocol, the rules of the communication system. 
- HTTPS: the S stands for Secure. 

2. URL paths
- To create a relative URL we leave off the domain name, but we include the initial slash at the very beginning. That tells the browser, go to the root level of the file structure, the outermost top level and start from there, or we can write the path to be relative from the file in which the link is written. 
- Anytime the browser is told to go to a URL that is folder, it automatically looks for an index.html file and loads it.
- The nav element `<nav></nav>` is for marking up navigation. It tells the browser which sets of links are part of the site navigation.
