## Understanding the power of HTML
 1. Debugging HTML
 We can use developer tools to inspect any website on the internet, and peek under the hood to see how other developers use HTML. We can also use HTML inspector in dev tools to help us debug mistakes
 2. HTML attributes 
 Global Attributes are attributes in HTML that will work on any element. 
 - class attribute

 <img src="class attributes.png" width="400">

 - Id attributes is similar to class.
 There will only ever be one element with any particular ID name, which becomes useful when interacting with JavaScript or links.
 - lang
 - dir 

 3. ARIA roles
 The layer of information conveyed by ARIA tells screen readers, braille displays, magnifiers and other assistive technology things they need to know to make a site fully accessible. 

 4. Formatting HTML
 - comment in HTML `<!-- a comment in HTML -->`
 - Best practice is to put a slash at the end of any element that otherwise didn't have a closing tag.

 5. Weird characters
 - The W3C keeps a reference chart of all the character entities where you can mark them up.
 - &nbsp; for non breaking space
