Summary on Accessibility of Members from Static & Instance Methods
In the last lecture, we discussed about which class members (variables or methods) can be accessed from static & instance methods. Just to be completely clear, here is a summary of that same information.

a) Accessibility from Static Methods:

Cannot directly access instance variables/methods defined in the same class as the static method

Can directly access static variables/methods defined in the same class

Can access anything via an object reference. So, from a static method by using an object reference, we can access instance variables/methods

b) Accessibility from Instance Methods:

Can access anything from an instance method. So, we can even access static variables/methods defined in the same class as the instance method.
