## Controls in Power Apps

1. A control is a UI element that produces an action or shows information. Many
   controls in Power Apps are similar to controls that you've used in other
   apps: labels, text-input boxes, drop-down lists, navigation elements, and so
   on.
2. In addition to these typical controls, Power Apps has more specialized
   controls, which you can find on the Insert tab.

- A few controls that can add interest and impact to your apps include:
- Galleries - These controls are layout containers that hold a set of controls
  that show records from a data source.
- Forms - These controls show details about your data and let you create and
  edit records.
- Media - These controls let you add background images, include a camera button
  (so that users can take pictures from the app), a barcode reader for quickly
  capturing identification information, and more.
- Charts - These controls let you add charts so that users can perform instant
  analysis while they're on the road.
