## Benefits of using Dataverse and its tables include:

1. Simple to manage - Both the metadata and data are stored in the cloud so that
   you're confident about the details of how they're stored.

2. Helps secure your data - Data is stored so that users can see it only if you
   grant them access. Role-based security allows you to control access to tables
   for different users within your organization.

3. Access your Dynamics 365 data - If you use Dynamics 365, data from your
   Dynamics 365 application is also stored within Dataverse, allowing you to
   quickly build apps that use your Dynamics 365 data and extend your apps by
   using Power Apps.

4. Rich metadata - Data types and relationships are used directly within Power
   Apps.

5. Logic and validation - Define calculated fields, business rules, workflows,
   and business process flows to ensure data quality and drive business
   processes.

6. Productivity tools - Tables are available within the add-ins for Microsoft
   Excel to increase productivity and ensure data accessibility.
