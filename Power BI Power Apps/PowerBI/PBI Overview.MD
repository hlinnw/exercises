# what is BI, business intelligence?
1. BI comprises the strategies and technologies used by enterprises for the data analysis of business information. BI technologies provide historical, current, and predictive views of business operations. BI technologies can handle large amounts of structured and sometimes unstructured data to help identify, develop, and otherwise create new strategic business opportunities.
2. BI is most effective when it combines data derived from the market in which a company operates (external data) with data from internal sources such as financial and operations data (internal data). When combined, external and internal data can provide a complete picture which, in effect, creates an "intelligence" that cannot be derived from any singular set of data to gain insight into new markets, to assess demand and suitability of products and services for different market segments, and to estimate the impact of marketing efforts.
 1. metadata: Metadata is data about data. A simple example of metadata for a document might include a collection of information like the author, file size, the date the document was created, and keywords to describe the document. 
 2. unstructured data: In the context of relational database systems, unstructured data cannot be stored in predictably ordered columns and rows. 
 3. business intelligence vs business analytics: Business intelligence and business analytics are sometimes used interchangeably, but there are alternate definitions. Business intelligence should be divided into querying, reporting, Online analytical processing (OLAP), an "alerts" tool, and business analytics. In this definition, business analytics is the subset of BI focusing on statistics, prediction, and optimization, rather than the reporting functionality.
